1,"We may loose people throughout the years starting thousands of years of torture and death. But in the present day we still get tortured for example North Korea kills innocents for not listening to their rules but if you try to escape from North Korea and you see a military boat coming to kill you or take you back pray to god and if they shoot you or even try to run you over you may bleed all over your body but never give up your freedom and liberty you keep fighting till the end and you may escape also in the future there is gonna be a war about heaven and hell fighting but when your in that war you see innocents die you praise to god and ask mercy for you and your allies and family till the truth will come god will send you power and you fight for your family, country, and your freedom if you die it’s not the end you will get back up and keep fighting and someone else will do it and may god be with us all through this nightmare even when you feel alone you have somebody with you and that is your family in your heart to guide you even god or Jesus don’t ever give up your freedom do your best we shall fight any where from the heavens or even your house you still will win the fight but even famous people or you have to do a sacrifice for you and your family and may be god with you forever in name of Jesus !!!!! Amen !!!!!!!"
